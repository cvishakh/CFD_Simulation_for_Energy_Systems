# CFD_Simulation_for_Energy_Systems
This file directory includes a project report completed at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.
The following document presents a summary of the CFD simulations performed by Mr Harikrishnan Sabu and Mr Vishakh Cheruparambath as part of the requirement for the completion of the course “CFD- Simulation for Energy Systems” during the summer semester of 2022.
This report is focused on Karman vortex formation, while a medium of water is allowed to flow over a cylinder. An iterative approach was applied for all the models considered, improving the models step by step towards the optimum solution. Several iterations were repeated, with constructive feedback from our professor.
All the simulations described in this report have been carried out using ANSYS CFD software: Space Claim for geometrical modelling, CFD Prep Post for mesh generation, Fluent for setting boundary and flow conditions, and finally CFD Post for post-processing.
